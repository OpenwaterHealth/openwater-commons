## Strategic Priorities

### 1. Permissive Licensing (Critical Path)
**Why:** AGPL blocks clinical translation and academic partnerships  
**Action:** Transition to Apache 2.0 (software) + CERN-OHL-P (hardware)  
**Timeline:** Q1 2026  
**Evidence:** 3D Slicer rejection documented

### 2. Hardware Accessibility
**Why:** Scattered CAD files block community hardware development  
**Action:** Separate mechanical/electrical, add BOMs, assembly guides  
**Timeline:** Q1-Q2 2026  
**Impact:** Enable reproducible community builds

### 3. Community First
**Why:** "Hundreds of developers" is CEO Priority #4  
**Action:** Professional infrastructure, clear pathways, recognition  
**Timeline:** Ongoing throughout 2026  
**Target:** 500+ contributors by end of 2026

### 4. Revenue Diversification
**Why:** "Revenue beyond hardware" is CEO Priority #3  
**Action:** Research licensing, pharma partnerships, enterprise SaaS  
**Timeline:** Q1-Q4 2026  
**Target:** $1M+ from non-hardware sources

### 5. Clinical Translation
**Why:** Open-source enabling real healthcare impact  
**Action:** FDA submissions, CE marking, clinical trials support  
**Timeline:** Q2-Q4 2026  
**Impact:** First open-source medical devices reaching patients

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: FDA Delays
**Impact:** Delays enterprise healthcare revenue  
**Mitigation:** Focus on research licensing and pharma partnerships (non-FDA)  
**Contingency:** Accelerate European CE marking path

### Risk: Slow Community Adoption
**Impact:** Missing "hundreds of developers" goal  
**Mitigation:** Developer Advocate hire, showcase projects, bounties  
**Contingency:** Increase incentives, partner with universities

### Risk: License Transition Resistance
**Impact:** Community confusion or pushback  
**Mitigation:** Clear communication, 3D Slicer evidence, CLA process  
**Contingency:** Extended transition period, 1:1 contributor support

### Risk: Hardware Reproduction Challenges
**Impact:** Community can't build devices  
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive BOMs, assembly guides, supplier info  
**Contingency:** Hardware workshops, maker space partnerships

### Risk: Competitive Response
**Impact:** Traditional vendors counter with open offerings  
**Mitigation:** First-mover advantage, network effects, quality focus  
**Contingency:** Differentiate on community, speed, cost
